- The goal of the final week is to make the transition to working with real world signals. Also I want to see what happens
when I apply output smoothing.

- Smoothing works pretty well with basic signals but I don't think it'll be very effective with the purposefully distorted signals

- Step one is to apply the basic network to signals, step two is to try a hand designed network arch
- I'm considering the following
1025 -> straight -> 205 -> fully -> 205 -> straight -> 1025
  |> ->          ->     ->       ->     ->          -> |^

- The transition was surprisingly successful. The results of the simple network are astonishing after applying noise filtering.
I have high hopes for the other arch.

- The first test of the new arch is absolutely awful. Fitness values in the simple network are usually between -8 and -40
This test started at -45000 and made it to -8000.

- After some minor tweaks the network is now performaing nominally.

- The new architecture beat the previous best fitness (achieved in 500 generations) in 33 generations.

- Listening back to the results: the new arch puts more emphasis on the harmonics, which is neat

- With the new arch, scaling is no longer relevant because the network naturally starts very close to the optimal output.
