- I spent a little while working with the data I gathered from last week. It needed to be formatted, so I wrote a python
script for that.

- This week I will transition to working with real samples from the bass guitar. I would like to spend more time working
with the synthetic samples but I don't have enough time for that.

- Instead of recording all 200 samples( 100 clean and 100 with distortion ). I'm going to record a few of each and see what I
can get out of those before wasting time recording more.

- 4 samples with and without distortion were made. 

- Something very strange has happened. The scripts I've been using to read and write stft data have suddenly stopped working.
This is very strange given that I haven't touched them, and can verify they haven't changed. I've checked on a second machine
and the problem persists, so i must've changed something somewhere.

- The issue was a loss of data when taking the absolute value of the stft data before writing it to a file. It has been
fixed but presents some larger problems, mostly dealing with complex values in the input to my network.
