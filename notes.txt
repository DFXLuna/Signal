Week 1 notes

- Output of FFT is in whole number frequencies where as musical notes usually have decimal points
the difference matters less as pitch increases( at ~ 500Hz it becomes difficult to tell ) but, 
in the effort of creating a bass pedal, this will matter.

- In light of the above, I will be using librosa's stft as the main engine for input processing instead
- Music Information Retrieval

- The input preprocessing pipeline has been established. The STFT of the input and target files are created and stored as text
- Embedding Python in C++ code has been implemented, this will be used to take advantage of librosa from c++.
- Several functions for dealing with numpy arrays( stored as text ) have been implemented for c++.

- I've modified the neural network code from in class and cleaned it up.
