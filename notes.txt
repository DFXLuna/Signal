Week 1 notes

- Output of FFT is in whole number frequencies where as musical notes usually have decimal points
the difference matters less as pitch increases but, in the effort of creating a bass pedal, this will matter.

- In light of the above, I will be using librosa's stft as the main engine for input processing instead
- Music Information Retrieval

- The input preprocessing pipeline has been established. The STFT of the input and target wav files are created and stored as text
- Embedding Python in C++ code has been implemented, this will be used to take advantage of librosa from c++.
