# Signal
This was an experiment performed for an Evolutionary AI class in which I attempted to use an evolutionary algorithm to generate a neural network capable of taking an input signal(like a bass guitar) a modified signal(like a bass guitar with distortion) and figuring out how to get from the input to the output in a way that it can be applied to arbitrary signals.
